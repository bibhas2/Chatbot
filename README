Chatbot is a very simple Minecraft Bukkit plugin. It responds to every chat message. It can use
any chatbot from the http://www.pandorabots.com/ web site. By default, it uses the
Chomsky bot which is pretty good and knows Wikipedia well.

It's fun for little kids to talk to a chatbot.

INSTALLATION
============
Copy Chatbot.jar to the plugins/ folder of your Bukkit server.

Start the server. You should see the log message:

[Chatbot] Enabling Chatbot v1.0

Configuration
=============
After you have started the server, you will see the plugins/Chatbot/config.yml file.
Open the file and change the botid parameter to use another bot. For a list of bots,
go to: http://www.pandorabots.com/botmaster/en/mostactive. Click a link to see the botid
in the URL address.
